# DATA is specified as type {PE,JUMP,OTHER,PACBIO} and 5 fields:
# 1)two_letter_prefix 2)mean 3)stdev 4)fastq(.gz)_fwd_reads
# 5)fastq(.gz)_rev_reads. The PE reads are always assumed to be
# innies, i.e. --->.<---, and JUMP are assumed to be outties
# <---.--->. If there are any jump libraries that are innies, such as
# longjump, specify them as JUMP and specify NEGATIVE mean. Reverse reads
# are optional for PE libraries and mandatory for JUMP libraries. Any
# OTHER sequence data (454, Sanger, Ion torrent, etc) must be first
# converted into Celera Assembler compatible .frg files (see
# http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.com)

PARAMETERS
#PLEASE READ all comments to essential parameters below, and set the parameters according to your project
#set this to 1 if your Illumina jumping library reads are shorter than 100bp
EXTEND_JUMP_READS=0
#this is k-mer size for deBruijn graph values between 25 and 127 are supported, auto will compute the optimal size based on the read data and GC content
GRAPH_KMER_SIZE = auto
#set this to 1 for all Illumina-only assemblies
#set this to 0 if you have more than 15x coverage by long reads (Pacbio or Nanopore) or any other long reads/mate pairs (Illumina MP, Sanger, 454, etc)
USE_LINKING_MATES = 1
#specifies whether to run the assembly on the grid
USE_GRID=0
#specifies grid engine to use SGE or SLURM
GRID_ENGINE=SGE
#specifies queue (for SGE) or partition (for SLURM) to use when running on the grid MANDATORY
GRID_QUEUE=all.q
#batch size in the amount of long read sequence for each batch on the grid
GRID_BATCH_SIZE=500000000
#use at most this much coverage by the longest Pacbio or Nanopore reads, discard the rest of the reads
#can increase this to 30 or 35 if your reads are short (N50<7000bp)
LHE_COVERAGE=25
#set to 0 (default) to do two passes of mega-reads for slower, but higher quality assembly, otherwise set to 1
MEGA_READS_ONE_PASS=0
#this parameter is useful if you have too many Illumina jumping library mates. Typically set it to 60 for bacteria and 300 for the other organisms
LIMIT_JUMP_COVERAGE = 300
#these are the additional parameters to Celera Assembler.  do not worry about performance, number or processors or batch sizes -- these are computed automatically.
#CABOG ASSEMBLY ONLY: set cgwErrorRate=0.25 for bacteria and 0.1<=cgwErrorRate<=0.15 for other organisms.
CA_PARAMETERS =  cgwErrorRate=0.15 ovlThreads=2 frgCorrThreads=2
#CABOG ASSEMBLY ONLY: whether to attempt to close gaps in scaffolds with Illumina  or long read data
CLOSE_GAPS=1
#auto-detected number of cpus to use, set this to the number of CPUs/threads per node you will be using
NUM_THREADS = 30
#this is mandatory jellyfish hash size -- a safe value is estimated_genome_size*20
JF_SIZE = 10000000000
#ILLUMINA ONLY. Set this to 1 to use SOAPdenovo contigging/scaffolding module.  Assembly will be worse but will run faster. Useful for very large (>=8Gbp) genomes from Illumina-only data
SOAP_ASSEMBLY=0
#Hybrid Illumina paired end + Nanopore/PacBio assembly ONLY.  Set this to 1 to use Flye assembler for final assembly of corrected mega-reads.  A lot faster than CABOG, at the expense of some contiguity. Works well even when MEGA_READS_ONE_PASS is set to 1.  DO NOT use if you have less than 15x coverage by long reads.
FLYE_ASSEMBLY=0
